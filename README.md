# genuary-2024
It's 2024 and GENUARY resolves its Promise! GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.

It is an annual event that encourages creators to generate and share creative code-based artwork throughout the month of January. The challenge provides daily prompts, inspiring participants to explore various aspects of generative art.
